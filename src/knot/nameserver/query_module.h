 *
 * \brief Query module interface
 *
 * The concept of query plan is simple - each query requires a finite
 * number of steps to be solved. For example IN query needs to find an answer and
 * based on the result, process authority and maybe supply additional records.
 * This can be represented by a query plan:
 * answer => { find_answer },
 * authority => { process_authority },
 * additional => { process_additional }
 *
 * The example is obvious, but if a state is passed between the callbacks,
 * same principle applies for every query processing.
 * This file provides an interface for basic query plan and more importantly
 * dynamically loaded modules that can alter query plans.
 * For a default internet zone query plan, see \file internet.h
 *
