.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Configuration file for Knot DNS uses simplified YAML format. Simplified means
that not all features are supported.
.sp
For the configuration items description, there are some symbol with the
folowing meaning:

.IP \(bu 2
\fIBOOL\fP \- Boolean value (\fBon\fP or \fBoff\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
\fITIME\fP \- Number of seconds, integer with possible time mutliplier suffix
(\fBs\fP ~ 1, \fBm\fP ~ 60, \fBh\fP ~ 3600 or \fBd\fP ~ 24 * 3600)
.IP \(bu 2
\fISIZE\fP \- Number of bytes, integer with possible size multiplier suffix
(\fBB\fP ~ 1, \fBK\fP ~ 1024, \fBM\fP ~ 1024^2 or \fBG\fP ~ 1024^3)
.IP \(bu 2
\fIBASE64\fP \- Base64 encoded string
.IP \(bu 2
\fIADDR\fP \- IPv4 or IPv6 address
.IP \(bu 2

.UNINDENT
.sp
There are 8 main sections (\fBserver\fP, \fBkey\fP, \fBacl\fP, \fBcontrol\fP,
\fBremote\fP, \fBtemplate\fP, \fBzone\fP and \fBlog\fP) and module sections with
\fBmod\-\fP prefix . Most of the sections (excluding \fBserver\fP and
\fBcontrol\fP) are sequences of settings blocks. Each settings block
begins with a unique identifier, which can be used as a reference from other
sections (such identifier must be defined in advance).
.sp
Multi\-valued item can be specified either as a YAML sequence [val1, val2, ...]
or as more single\-valued items each on the extra line.
.sp
If an item value contains spaces or other special characters, it is necessary
to double quote such value with \fB"\fP \fB"\fP\&.
.SH COMMENTS
.sp
A comment begins with a \fB#\fP character and is ignored during the processing.
Also each configuration section or sequence block allows to specify permanent
comment using \fBcomment\fP item which is stored in the server beside the
configuration.
.SH INCLUDES
.sp
Another configuration file or all configuration files in a directory can be
included at the top level in the current file. If the file or directory path
is not absolute, then it is relative to the current file directory.

.SS identity
.sp
An identity of the server returned in the response for the query for TXT
record \fBid.server.\fP or \fBhostname.bind.\fP in the CHAOS class (see RFC 4892).
If empty, FQDN hostname is used.
.sp
Default: disabled
.SS version
.sp
A version of the server software returned in the response for the query
for TXT record \fBversion.server.\fP or \fBversion.bind.\fP in the CHAOS
class (see RFC 4892). If empty, automatic version is used.
.sp
Default: disabled
.SS nsid
.sp
A DNS name server identifier (see RFC 5001). If empty, FQDN hostname is used.
.sp
Default: disabled
.SS rundir
.sp
A path for storing run\-time data (PID file, unix sockets, etc.).
.sp
Default: \fB${localstatedir}/run/knot\fP (configured with \fB\-\-with\-rundir=path\fP)
.SS user
.sp
A system user with an optional system group (\fIuser\fP:\fIgroup\fP) under which the
server is run after starting and binding to interfaces. Linux capabilities
are employed if supported.
.sp
Default: root:root
.SS pidfile
.sp
A PID file location.
.sp
Default: \fI\%rundir\fP/knot.pid
.SS workers
.sp
A number of quering workers (threads) per server interface.
.sp
Default: auto\-estimated optimal value based on the number of online CPUs
.SS background\-workers
.sp
A number of workers (threads) used to execute background operations (zone
loading, zone updates, etc.).
.sp
Default: auto\-estimated optimal value based on the number of online CPUs
.SS asynchronous\-start
.sp
If enabled, server doesn\(aqt wait for the zones to be loaded and starts
responding immediately with SERVFAIL answers until the zone loads.
.sp
Default: off
.SS max\-conn\-idle
.sp
Maximum idle time between requests on a TCP connection. This also limits
receiving of a single query, each query must be received in this time limit.
.sp
Default: 20
.SS max\-conn\-handshake
.sp
Maximum time between newly accepted TCP connection and the first query.
This is useful to disconnect inactive connections faster than connections
that already made at least 1 meaningful query.
.sp
Default: 5
.SS max\-conn\-reply
.sp
Maximum time to wait for a reply to an issued SOA query.
.sp
Default: 10
.SS max\-tcp\-clients
.sp
A maximum number of TCP clients connected in parallel, set this below the file
descriptor limit to avoid resource exhaustion.
.sp
Default: 100
.SS transfers
.sp
A maximum number of parallel transfers, including pending SOA queries. The
minimum value is determined by the number of CPUs.
.sp
Default: 10
.SS rate\-limit
.sp
Rate limiting is based on the token bucket scheme. Rate basically
represents number of tokens available each second. Each response is
processed and classified (based on several discriminators, e.g.
source netblock, qtype, name, rcode, etc.). Classified responses are
then hashed and assigned to a bucket containing number of available
tokens, timestamp and metadata. When available tokens are exhausted,
response is rejected or enters \fI\%SLIP\fP
(server responds with a truncated response). Number of available tokens
is recalculated each second.
.sp
Default: 0 (disabled)
.SS rate\-limit\-size
.sp
Size of hashtable buckets. The larger the hashtable, the lesser probability
of a hash collision, but at the expense of additional memory costs. Each bucket
is estimated roughly to 32 bytes. Size should be selected as a reasonably large
prime due to the better hash function distribution properties. Hash table is
internally chained and works well up to a fill rate of 90 %, general
rule of thumb is to select a prime near 1.2 * maximum_qps.
.sp
Default: 393241
.SS rate\-limit\-slip
.sp
As attacks using DNS/UDP are usually based on a forged source address,
an attacker could deny services to the victim netblock if all
responses would be completely blocked. The idea behind SLIP mechanism
is to send each Nth response as truncated, thus allowing client to
reconnect via TCP for at least some degree of service. It is worth
noting, that some responses can\(aqt be truncated (e.g. SERVFAIL).
.sp
It is advisable not to set the slip interval to a value larger than 2,
as too large slip value means more denial of service for legitimate
requestors, and introduces excessive timeouts during resolution.
On the other hand, slipping truncated answer gives the legitimate
requestors a chance to reconnect over TCP.
.sp
Default: 1
.SS max\-udp\-payload
.sp
Maximum EDNS0 UDP payload size.
.sp
Default: 4096
.SS listen
.sp

.sp
Default: 5
.SS zonefile\-sync
.sp
The time after which the current zone in memory will be synced to zone file
on the disk (see \fI\%file\fP). The server will serve the latest
zone even after restart using zone journal, but the zone file on the disk will
only be synced after \fBzonefile\-sync\fP time has expired (or after manual zone
flush) This is applicable when the zone is updated via IXFR, DDNS or automatic

the immediate sync to zone file is not desirable, increase the default value.
.sp

zone file upon server reload. This option is only relevant if the server
is a master server for the zone.

Expiration will thus be set as current time (in the moment of signing)
+ \fBsignature\-lifetime\fP\&. The signatures are refreshed one tenth of the
signature lifetime before the signature expiration (i.e. 3 days before the
expiration with the default value). Minimum possible value is 10801.
.sp
Default: 30 * 24 * 3600
.SS serial\-policy

\fBincrement\fP \- The serial is incremented according to serial number arithmetic
.IP \(bu 2
\fBunixtime\fP \- The serial is set to the current unix time
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fICaution:\fP If your serial was in other than unix time format, be careful
with the transition to unix time.  It may happen that the new serial will
be \(aqlower\(aq than the old one. If this is the case, the transition should be
done by hand (see RFC 1982).
